Very reluctant, but puppet nevertheless. Severing one string at a time, since 1987.

Maker first. I love making beautiful things, especially things that didn't exist in this world before I was born.

#### What I'm doing now

For the moneys, I run software companies focused on the US market.

With the time I buy with that money, I teach. I love learning and teaching. I co-run an [Education studio](https://theseconddesign.com/) for that purpose.

### Previously

In 2015, I co-founded an online student startup incubator, [Startup Village Collective, SV.CO](https://yourstory.com/2016/07/startup-village).

We failed to make the venture sustainable, but we had a lot of fun attempting something grand.

In 2019, we pivoted and rebranded Startup Village Collective into an ed-tech company called [Pupilfirst](https://www.pupilfirst.org/).

### That's me back in 2017, in Bhutan
